###Acknowledgement
The source code for the Kilobot firmware was cloned from Alex Acornejo's [repository](https://github.com/acornejo/kilolib), and we have made some minor modifications for the purpose of our project. Particularly disabling infrared transmission to free up Timer0 and instead use it for the Openswarm system and I/O timers.
